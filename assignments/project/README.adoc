= Read Separator
You will be making a program that can accept one or more fastq
input files that contain forward and reverse reads interleaved. 
The program will create a directory for each file that has the basename
of the file given, and inside the directory there will be two written 
files that contain forward reads and reverse reads. The file names will
include the oiginal input file name and either `_f` or `_r`.

Write a Python program called `separator.py` that will separate forward 
and reverse interleaved reads from the given input files.

The inputs are in the project directory and are labeled `file1.fastq`
and `file2.fastq`.


The program must contain the parameters:
  
    * One or more positional FILE arguments
    * `-d|--outdir`: name of the output directory

Here is the usage your program should create for `-h` or `--help`:

....
 $ ./separator.py --help
 usage: separator.py [-h] [-d DIR] FILE [FILE ...]
     
 Separates forward and reversed reads from interleaved lines
 
 positional arguments:
   FILE                  A FASTQ file
                                                             
 optional arguments:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   -d DIR, --outdir DIR  Output directory (default: out)
....
