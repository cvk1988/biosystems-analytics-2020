= *Read Separator*
[.lead]
You will be making a program that can accept one or more fasta or fastq
input files that contain forward and reverse reads in alternate lines. 
The program will create a directory for each file that has the basename
of the file given, and inside the directory there will be two written 
files that contain forward reads and reverse reads. The file names will
include the oiginal input file name and either _f or _r.

Write a Python program called 'separator.py' that will separate forward 
and reverse reads from the given input files.
